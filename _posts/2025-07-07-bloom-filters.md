## Understanding Bloom Filters: A Probabilistic Powerhouse

### Introduction

When dealing with large-scale data systems — especially where memory and speed matter — we often face a simple but important question:  
**“Have I seen this item before?”**

You might reach for a `HashSet` or database index — but what if memory is tight and occasional false positives are acceptable?  
That’s where **Bloom Filters** come in.

### What is a Bloom Filter?

A **Bloom Filter** is a *space-efficient probabilistic data structure* used to test **whether an element is a member of a set**. It can return:

- **Definitely not in the set**
- **Possibly in the set**

The trade-off? It **can return false positives**, but **never false negatives**.

---

### How Does It Work?

A Bloom filter is essentially:

- A **bit array** of size `m`, initialized to all 0s.
- `k` different **hash functions** that map input to positions in the bit array.

#### Insertion:
To insert an element:
1. Hash the element with all `k` hash functions.
2. Set each corresponding bit to 1.

#### Lookup:
To check membership:
1. Hash the element with the same `k` functions.
2. If *any* of the corresponding bits are 0 → **definitely not in the set**.
3. If *all* are 1 → **possibly in the set**.

Lets try to visualize this with the help of an interactive codepen. We can add a word, and test if a word exists with the help of the <kbd>Add</kbd>/<kbd>Test</kbd> buttons.

The filter will output one of the two messages. 
- `"word" is definitely not in the filter.` : When the filter is sure the word doesnot exists.
- `"word" might be in the filter.` : When the filter thinks the word might be present.

### Trade-offs: False Positives

Bloom filters are fast and memory-efficient, but they **can’t remove elements**, and **false positives** are possible.

The false positive rate depends on:

- Number of hash functions `k`
- Size of bit array `m`
- Number of inserted elements `n`

The probability of a false positive is:

$$
\begin{equation}
  P \approx \left(1 - e^{- \frac{kn}{m}} \right)^k
  \label{eq:bloom-false-positive}
\end{equation}
$$

### When Should You Use a Bloom Filter?

#### Use cases:
- Caching layers (check if it's worth looking up an item)
- Distributed systems (avoid expensive queries)
- Email spam detection
- Web crawler visited URLs

#### Ideal when:
- You don’t need to delete items.
- You can tolerate false positives.
- Memory usage matters more than perfect accuracy.

### Java Implementation

```java
  public class BloomFilter {
    private BitSet bitset;
    private int bitSize;
    private int hashCount;

    public BloomFilter(int bitSize, int hashCount) {
        this.bitSize = bitSize;
        this.hashCount = hashCount;
        this.bitset = new BitSet(bitSize);
    }

    public void add(String item) {
        for (int i = 0; i < hashCount; i++) {
            int hash = getHash(item, i);
            bitset.set(Math.abs(hash % bitSize));
        }
    }

    public boolean mightContain(String item) {
        for (int i = 0; i < hashCount; i++) {
            int hash = getHash(item, i);
            if (!bitset.get(Math.abs(hash % bitSize))) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    private int getHash(String item, int seed) {
        return item.hashCode() ^ (seed * 0x5bd1e995);
    }
}
```

### Final Thoughts

Bloom Filters are a great tool in the arsenal of backend engineers, especially when you're operating at scale and every byte of memory counts. They're not perfect, but they’re powerful — especially when used with intention.
