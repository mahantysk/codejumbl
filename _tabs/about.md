I'm a backend engineer with 12+ years of experience, passionate about building scalable, high-performance systems and leading teams to success. I love distributed systems, cloud-native architectures, and making things run faster and smoother (and cheaper!).

**Currently:** Leading engineering at **Wayfair**, where I design, develop, and optimize cloud-native microservices for business-critical apps. I’ve led zero-downtime migrations, scaled systems to 100K RPM, and reduced cloud costs by 20%.

**Previously:** I’ve made an impact at some of the world’s top tech companies:

- **Microsoft** – Built scalable ad tech, architected new ad types, and delivered $300K+ in revenue impact. Led hackathons and built distributed tracing platforms.
- **Walmart Labs** – Modernized e-commerce infrastructure, migrated stacks to Docker, and improved deployment workflows.
- **Target India** – Built high-throughput payment systems (120K TPS!), enhanced security, and dabbled in conversational AI for onboarding bots.
- **Akamai** – Optimized homepage load times from 7s to 100ms, built recommendation systems, and scaled apps 12x.

**Fun facts:** I love mentoring, hackathons, and sharing knowledge. My teams have won hackathons, and I enjoy making tech fun and collaborative. If you want to talk distributed systems, cloud, or just geek out about Java and Kubernetes, let’s connect!
